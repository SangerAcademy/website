<p class="c3"><span class="c2">Help us make a video encyclopedia for kids!</span></p><p class="c3"><br/>
<span class="c11">We can do it&mdash;but we need your support. We aren&rsquo;t rich and we aren&rsquo;t well-funded.</span></p><br/>

<p class="c3"><span class="c0">Who we are. </span><span class="c11">Dr. Sanger&rsquo;s story:</span></p><br/>
<p class="c3 c10"><span class="c11">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve come to call myself an online knowledge organizer, which I think makes sense, because I&rsquo;m a Ph.D. philosopher who focused on epistemology, the theory of knowledge. And I am co-founder of Wikipedia. A wiki encyclopedia was my idea, I named the site, and I led the community that built Wikipedia in its seminal first two years. Since then, I worked on a lot of educational sites&mdash;other encyclopedias, but also a directory of educational videos called </span>
<span class="c4"><a class="c9" href="http://www.watchknowlearn.org">WatchKnowLearn.org</a></span><span class="c11">&nbsp;and a site to teach kids to read, called </span>
<span class="c4"><a class="c9" href="http://www.readingbear.org">Reading Bear</a></span><span class="c11">.</span></p><br/>
<p class="c3 c10"><span class="c11">&ldquo;These sites, all of them, are free, ad-free, and non-profit. That might sound nice, and I&rsquo;m proud that my work has helped a lot of students, but it also means I never got rich. I never even got a stable career. Despite founding the project, I have never seen a penny from the millions raised by Wikipedia&rsquo;s nonprofit arm, the Wikimedia Foundation. If any part of your donation to Wikipedia is in thanks to the founders, then help me start Sanger Academy&mdash;which will also be an educational nonprofit.</span></p><br/>
<p class="c3 c10"><span class="c11">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m 47 years old. When I was about 30, I went straight from my academic studies as a philosopher, making almost no money, to making very little money in nonprofits and startups. I am very middle class. I live in central Ohio by choice. I guarantee I am by far the poorest founder of a top 10 website in the world. I have made a small name for myself organizing free knowledge&mdash;and I want to spend the rest of my life doing that.&rdquo;</span></p>
<br><p class="c3"><span class="c11">Our volunteer software engineer, John Michelsen, has also homeschooled his children. John worked on early versions of the Khan Academy website and got to know Larry through his blog and early reading essay. His youngest loves the videos as well.</span></p><p class="c3"><br/>

<span class="c11">We are looking for a volunteer designer now!</span></p><br/>

<p class="c3"><span class="c0">Why we love making educational videos.</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;When Larry first uploaded some educational videos in 2011-12, he didn&rsquo;t really expect them to take off, and they didn&rsquo;t&mdash;at first. But after a few years, he noticed that his most popular videos had hundreds of thousands of views. Traffic to those original 26 videos had climbed impressively. Larry made some calculations: making videos full-time for one year would result in 30-50 million views after a few years, and in terms of ad revenue, that would generate nearly enough to live on. So in 2016, Larry decided to start making new videos, which we believe are better than ever.</span></p><br/>

<p class="c3"><span class="c11">It&rsquo;s not just a matter of traffic, though. We love the idea that we can support the education of millions of kids with high-quality, free education.</span></p><br/>

<p class="c3"><span class="c0">Why our educational videos are popular.</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;Our videos get lots of praise from kids, parents, and teachers. We see words like these: interesting, fascinating, perfect (for class, for explaining something to a curious kid, for homeschooling, to prepare for a test, etc.); clear and listenable voice; good pacing; great for my elementary student, preschooler, or even for a teen or adult to review; very clear, &quot;I finally understand&quot;; and high quality.</span></p><br/>

<p class="c3"><span class="c11">But what really stands out is that, unlike many educational videos, the writing and explanations in our videos are extremely clear. The popularity of our videos was initially surprising to Larry because he thought they were very plain and basic. They are that, but it turns out that students&mdash;including both of Larry&rsquo;s sons, who love them&mdash;really appreciate a clear, straightforward, well-illustrated explanation. If you look at most educational videos online (and we&#39;ve looked at hours and hours of them) you&#39;ll find that most of them are very poor at actually teaching or clarifying anything. There&rsquo;s a lot of entertainment that goes on, but whether children actually gain understanding from the videos is another matter. </span></p><br/>

<p class="c3"><span class="c0">Why don&rsquo;t we use animations and songs?</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;Animation and songs often tend to distract from the </span><span class="c7">concepts</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;being taught, which are more abstract. Our videos make use of clear, large print on screen, together with simple images carefully chosen to teach the concepts, not just to entertain. Besides, animation and songs are expensive both in terms of time and money. Which is better: </span><span class="c7">thousands</span><span class="c11"> of Sanger Academy-style videos, or a few hundred slickly-produced videos?</span></p><br/>

<p class="c3"><span class="c11">It turns out that, despite being rather &ldquo;dry&rdquo; in appearance at first, many kids love our videos and can&rsquo;t get enough of them. Why? It&rsquo;s not hard to understand: Children love to grasp new things very clearly, and that is exactly what we facilitate. Salman Khan&rsquo;s videos, too, lack slick production values; but they work well because Khan is great at explaining things.</span></p><br/>

<p class="c3"><span class="c0">For funding, why don&rsquo;t we just do ads?</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;Well, we could. Maybe, in the end, we&rsquo;ll have to. But we don&rsquo;t want to, because it distracts from the learning experience. We believe we might be able to get enough </span>
<span class="c4"><a class="c9" href="https://www.patreon.com/SangerAcademy">support from donors</a></span><span class="c11">.</span></p><br/>

<p class="c3"><span class="c0">Why should a charity support Sanger Academy?</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;We&rsquo;ve made the case above, but let&rsquo;s talk about ROI. Working full time, Larry can make something like 35 videos per month all by himself. With a little extra help, perhaps from volunteers at first, he could produce even more, maybe 50 or 70. After a few years, those videos will </span><span class="c7">each </span><span class="c11">average around 50,000 views per year. Together, after a few years, we&rsquo;re talking about many tens of millions of views. That&rsquo;s a </span><span class="c7">huge</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;return on investment for education. So many nonprofit educational endeavors end up having little or no impact. Wouldn&rsquo;t it be nice to have something closer to a &ldquo;sure thing&rdquo;&mdash;particularly one that can be become self-supporting with small donations from individuals?</span></p><br/>

<p class="c3"><span class="c0">Why should a sponsor or partner support Sanger Academy? </span><span class="c11">Look at the traffic. If we co-brand with you on the videos themselves, you&rsquo;re going to get </span><span class="c7">millions</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;of prime, credible, first-seconds impressions. If you&rsquo;re an educational company that needs to get the word out&mdash;especially if you do early education, early elementary, or educational videos&mdash;this could be a great opportunity for you. </span></p><br/>

<p class="c3"><span class="c0">How you, regular folks, can help.</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;Here are five ways:</span></p><ol class="c14 lst-kix_list_2-0 start" start="1"><li class="c1"><span class="c5">Donate </span>
